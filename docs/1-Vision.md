# Problem Statement
At conferences, audiences often passively absorb content filled with buzzwords, leaving little room for authentic engagement, critical reflection, or a shared sense of fun. While sessions are rich with technical jargon and visionary language, participants frequently lack accessible, real-time ways to interact with the material—or with each other. There is a need for a lightweight, participatory tool that playfully disrupts this passivity, encourages collective attention, and makes both the limits and possibilities of rapid technology development immediately tangible.

# Solution
A web-based Buzzword Bingo app that injects play into passive settings, fosters real-time engagement, and showcases live feature development—turning keynote buzz into interactive possibility.

## Core Features
- Real-time bingo cards built from conference buzzwords
- Mobile- and projector-friendly interface for group play
- Admin panel to add new words, reset games, declare winners, and trigger celebration effects
- New game starts after a BINGO is called
- Designed to evolve live on stage with audience input

# Success Criteria
- Over 100 conference participants use the tool
- At least one person calls out “BINGO!” during a keynote
- The app becomes a topic of hallway conversation or social posts
- Participants leave with a clearer sense of how fast, fun, and interactive AI can be
- People laugh, learn, and feel more connected
