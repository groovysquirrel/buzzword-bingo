#Justin: I am working on a workshop for a conference. It's on the first day, right after the main keynote. It's a session on rapid prototyping with AI.

What I want to do is have a Conference Buzzword Bingo game. I will setup a very primitive version of it. For the user in the room with mobile phones, there will be a page with a bingo game card, a page to suggest new buzzwords, and a leaderboard. For the admin, there will be a word approver, and a game queue.

I want to make this easy for people to sign up to play but I don't want to expose my demonstration to cyber risk. How can I make it easy for people to sign into the game and participate without forcing them to create a username and password? 


# ChatGPT: Great idea ‚Äî Conference Buzzword Bingo is a perfect blend of fun, engagement, and showcasing rapid prototyping with AI.

To **balance ease of use with basic security and privacy**, here are **four low-friction sign-in options** that avoid usernames and passwords while minimizing risk:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Magic Link Sign-In (Email-based, No Passwords)**

**How it works:**

* User enters their email.
* They get a one-time "magic link" to click and sign in.
* The link expires after one use or a short time window (e.g., 10 minutes).

**Pros:**

* No passwords.
* Fairly secure.
* Can throttle access (e.g., limit to emails from a specific domain).

**Cons:**

* Slight friction (they need to check email).
* May not be ideal for a spontaneous audience.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **One-Click Anonymous Join With Nickname (Session Token)**

**How it works:**

* User chooses a nickname and clicks "Join Game".
* You assign them a temporary session token (stored in localStorage).
* Nicknames are visible on the leaderboard.

**Pros:**

* Instant participation, zero friction.
* No PII collected.
* Safe enough for a demo environment.

**Cons:**

* Users may pick inappropriate names (mitigated by moderation or auto-filter).
* Can't contact users if there's a post-session follow-up.

> üîê *Tip:* Consider a profanity filter or auto-moderation for nickname submission.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **QR Code Fast Entry (Token-based)**

**How it works:**

* You generate unique QR codes on each table or badge.
* Scanning it gives the user a one-time use token that signs them into the game.

**Pros:**

* No typing needed, super fast onboarding.
* Each QR code can link to a specific session/game instance.

**Cons:**

* Requires some physical setup ahead of time.
* Slightly more dev work.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Join via Code Word or PIN (Session Limited)**

**How it works:**

* You announce a code (e.g., `buzz123`) during the session.
* People enter it into the page to join the game.
* The code unlocks participation for a short window.

**Pros:**

* Easy to control access.
* No PII or account creation needed.
* Great for conference environments.

**Cons:**

* Users could share the code outside the room, but for a short demo, that's minimal risk.

---

### Recommended Setup for Your Use Case:

* ‚úÖ Use **nickname + session token** for frictionless access.
* ‚úÖ Combine with a **join code/PIN** to gate participation.
* ‚úÖ Admin page should allow **manual approval or banning** of submitted buzzwords and nicknames.
* üß† Optionally log IPs or user agents in memory (not stored) to flag abuse without persistent tracking.

---

Would you like a wireframe or code scaffold for this setup? I can provide a React+Tailwind frontend with Node or Serverless backend to get it running quickly.



# Justin: Let's explore nickname and session token. I'd want to track when people fill up a bingo sheet with words, in a dynamodb database. Can we communicate the nickname and a guid to the backend to write to the database? How do we prevent a bot from connecting to the backend relentlessly? 

# ChatGPT: 

Yes, using a **nickname + GUID (session token)** system is a solid, low-friction approach ‚Äî and it works well with DynamoDB.

Here‚Äôs how you can **safely architect the backend communication** while protecting against abuse (like bots) and tracking bingo progress:

---

## ‚úÖ Basic Setup: Nickname + GUID (Session Token)

### 1. **User Flow**

* On page load, generate a `GUID` (UUIDv4) for the user session.
* Prompt user to enter a nickname (with optional profanity filtering).
* Store `{ nickname, sessionId (GUID), createdAt }` in DynamoDB.
* Save the `GUID` in `localStorage` so the frontend keeps using it.

### 2. **Frontend Communication**

Every request (e.g., word selection, bingo submission) sends:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "GUID-here",
  "nickname": "CoolPerson",
  "action": "markWord",
  "payload": {
    "word": "synergy"
  }
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Backend Protection Against Bots

To prevent bots or denial of service abuse, implement the following layered defense:

### 1. **Rate Limiting per Session**

Store a `lastActionTimestamp` in memory (e.g., Redis or in-process) or track short-term activity in DynamoDB:

```json
{
  sessionId: "GUID",
  actionCountWindow: 15,
  windowStart: "timestamp"
}
```

Block or throttle requests that exceed X actions per minute.

### 2. **Token Signing (Lightweight Auth)**

Instead of plain GUIDs, sign them using HMAC with a shared secret:

```ts
signedToken = HMAC(secret, sessionId)
```

Validate signed token on backend to ensure it's not forged.

Pass token as:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "GUID",
  "token": "signed-value"
}
```

### 3. **Cloudflare Turnstile or Invisible CAPTCHA**

If you‚Äôre especially worried, add invisible CAPTCHA on:

* Bingo win submission
* Word suggestion
* High-impact endpoints

It‚Äôs free and low-latency via [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/).

### 4. **Throttling on IP + User-Agent**

Even without requiring login:

* Rate limit based on IP.
* Log User-Agent headers.
* Ignore requests missing either one.

---

## ‚úÖ DynamoDB Table Design (Minimal Schema)

### `Participants`

```json
{
  "sessionId": "GUID",
  "nickname": "CoolPerson",
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
```

### `BingoProgress`

```json
{
  "sessionId": "GUID",
  "word": "synergy",
  "markedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

### `CompletedBingo`

```json
{
  "sessionId": "GUID",
  "completedAt": "timestamp",
  "words": ["synergy", "alignment", ...]
}
```

Would you like boilerplate code or a repo structure (e.g., SST, Next.js, Node + DynamoDB SDK) to kickstart this build?


# Justin: Is there any reason this wouldn't work on mobile phones? 

# ChatGPT: To update your **Leaderboard in real time on a big screen** while people work on their Bingo sheets from their mobile phones, the best approach is to use **server-push technology** ‚Äî i.e., a real-time messaging system.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of **how to architect this cleanly and efficiently**:

---

## ‚úÖ Option 1: WebSockets (Best for Real-Time Interactions)

### How it works:

* The leaderboard client (the big screen) opens a persistent WebSocket connection to the backend.
* As players mark words or complete their sheet, your backend sends updates (e.g., percent complete) over WebSocket to the leaderboard client.
* The leaderboard updates instantly.

### Tech Stack Example:

* **Frontend**: JavaScript with WebSocket client.
* **Backend**: API Gateway (WebSocket mode) + Lambda + DynamoDB.
* **Bonus**: Use [Amazon API Gateway WebSocket API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api-overview.html) or [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) if self-hosted.

---

## ‚úÖ Option 2: Server-Sent Events (SSE, Simpler but One-Way)

### How it works:

* The big screen opens a one-way stream from the server (`/leaderboard/stream`).
* The server sends newline-delimited updates (`text/event-stream`) when bingo progress changes.
* Only the leaderboard gets real-time updates ‚Äî mobile users still use standard REST calls.

### Pros:

* Easier to set up than WebSockets.
* Lightweight and HTTP-based.
* Works great for display-only dashboards.

---

## ‚úÖ Option 3: Polling (Least Elegant, But Reliable)

### How it works:

* The leaderboard page polls the server every X seconds (e.g., 5s) for latest progress.
* The backend calculates % complete per player and returns a sorted list.

### Pros:

* No stateful connection needed.
* Very easy to implement (just a REST endpoint).

### Cons:

* Not truly real-time.
* Creates unnecessary load if not throttled.

---

## üéØ Recommended Implementation

If you're showing the leaderboard to a live audience on a big screen **and want that smooth, satisfying "live update" feeling**, go with:

### üî• WebSockets for Leaderboard + REST for Player Submissions

#### Player Experience (Mobile)

* Mobile submits progress via REST (`POST /mark-word`)
* Backend updates `BingoProgress` in DynamoDB
* Backend checks updated % complete

#### Leaderboard Experience (Big Screen)

* Leaderboard opens WebSocket connection to backend
* Backend pushes:

  ```json
  {
    "event": "progressUpdate",
    "data": [
      { "nickname": "Alice", "percent": 80 },
      { "nickname": "Bob", "percent": 60 }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Backend Trigger

* Lambda processes word updates ‚Üí recalculates progress ‚Üí sends update to WebSocket-connected leaderboard

---

## üîê Security Tips

* Only allow leaderboard socket to subscribe to global updates (no player-specific data).
* Authenticate leaderboard client with a secret key or role flag.

---

Would you like:

* A sample JSON schema for leaderboard updates?
* A boilerplate in Node.js using AWS API Gateway WebSocket?
* Or a simpler approach using polling as a fallback?

Let me know how real-time you need it and what backend tech you‚Äôre using (SST, Express, etc.) ‚Äî I can scaffold it for you.


# Justin: Compare 1 and 2. Would 2 be easier for all users to access to leaderboard? Updates could go to /{game-id}/stream ?

# ChatGPT: Great question ‚Äî let's directly compare **Option 1 (WebSockets)** and **Option 2 (Server-Sent Events, or SSE)** with your use case in mind: displaying a live-updating **leaderboard on a public screen**, sourced from mobile user activity.

---

## üîÑ TL;DR: Quick Comparison

| Feature                                    | **WebSockets (Option 1)**                       | **SSE (Option 2)**                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup Complexity**                       | Medium to High                                  | Low                                                      |
| **Browser Compatibility**                  | Universal                                       | Near-universal, but **not in IE/old Safari**             |
| **Message Direction**                      | **Two-way (bi-directional)**                    | **One-way (server ‚Üí client)**                            |
| **Ease of Scaling (e.g. via API Gateway)** | OK but trickier without managed infra           | **Very easy** with standard HTTP infra                   |
| **Latency**                                | Excellent                                       | Excellent                                                |
| **Best Use Case**                          | Live chat, multi-user games, control dashboards | Live data display or event feeds (like your leaderboard) |
| **Mobile-Friendliness**                    | Good, but requires open socket                  | Excellent ‚Äî works over simple HTTP                       |
| **Endpoint Design**                        | Persistent upgrade to socket                    | Simple `GET /{game-id}/stream` URL                       |

---

## üß† In Your Context: Public Leaderboard Display

You're asking:

> Would SSE be easier for **all users** to access the leaderboard? Could updates go to `/{game-id}/stream`?

**Yes** ‚Äî for **displaying the leaderboard**, **SSE is the easiest and most robust option**.

### ‚úÖ Why SSE is Great for Leaderboard

* The **big screen client** is the only one subscribing to updates.
* It **doesn‚Äôt need to send messages back**, just watch for updates.
* It works well in browsers **without requiring special JS libraries or handshake protocols**.
* You can push updates from the backend as simple `text/event-stream` data whenever a player's progress changes.

---

## ‚úÖ Proposed Flow Using SSE

### 1. **Big Screen Leaderboard Page**

* Calls: `GET /buzzbingo/{game-id}/stream`
* Server responds with a long-lived HTTP connection streaming events like:

  ```
  event: progressUpdate
  data: {"nickname": "Alice", "percent": 80}
  ```

### 2. **Backend Triggers**

* Player marks a word ‚Üí `POST /buzzbingo/{game-id}/mark-word`
* Server recalculates % complete ‚Üí pushes update to `/stream` connections

### 3. **Frontend Code (Leaderboard)**

```js
const evtSource = new EventSource(`/buzzbingo/${gameId}/stream`);
evtSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  updateLeaderboard(data);
};
```

---

## üÜö When You'd Pick WebSockets Instead

Only if:

* Multiple clients needed to **interact** with each other in real-time (e.g., battleship or chat).
* You needed full duplex communication or mobile clients to receive live messages (e.g., "Player X just won!").

---

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

Use **SSE (`/{game-id}/stream`) for leaderboard display**. It gives you:

* Simplicity
* Great compatibility
* Real-time streaming
* Easy deployment on serverless (e.g., AWS Lambda via API Gateway HTTP)

If you later expand into multi-user back-and-forth interactivity (like real-time player-vs-player games), then layer in WebSockets.

---

Would you like:

* A sample SSE stream server (Node or Python)?
* A Cloud setup plan (e.g., AWS API Gateway + Lambda + SSE-compatible proxy)?
* A way to simulate updates from DynamoDB triggers?


# Justin: you said "You needed full duplex communication or mobile clients to receive live messages (e.g., "Player X just won!")." But the server COULD push a message via SSE that the player won, no?

# ChatGPT: You're absolutely right ‚Äî yes, the **server *can* absolutely push a ‚ÄúPlayer X just won!‚Äù message** via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.

Let‚Äôs clarify:

---

## ‚úÖ SSE *Can* Do Real-Time Notifications (Including ‚ÄúPlayer X Won‚Äù)

SSE is **one-way** (server ‚Üí client), but that‚Äôs all you need for:

* Live leaderboard updates
* Bingo sheet completion notifications
* Chat-like system announcements (e.g., ‚ÄúNew word added!‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlayer Y submitted BINGO!‚Äù)

Example SSE message:

```
event: bingoWin
data: { "nickname": "PlayerX", "completedAt": "2025-06-03T15:20:00Z" }
```

Frontend can listen like:

```js
evtSource.addEventListener("bingoWin", (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  showBanner(`${data.nickname} just got BINGO!`);
});
```

---

## üîÑ The Limitation of SSE Is Just This:

* **Clients can't push data back over the same channel.**

  * So players can‚Äôt *reply* via SSE.
  * But that‚Äôs **irrelevant** for your use case ‚Äî players will use standard `POST` REST calls for that anyway.

---

## üß† Summary

You were exactly right to question that line ‚Äî **SSE is totally capable of broadcasting event-based updates like ‚ÄúPlayer X just won‚Äù**, and is **a perfect fit** for:

* Displaying the public leaderboard
* Pushing any server-generated announcement or state change
* Scaling easily over HTTP

So yes, **go with SSE** for all push-based messages ‚Äî including **game win announcements**.

Would you like a working example of an SSE server (Node.js or Python) that can emit these kinds of events and a sample frontend to consume them?


# Justin: I am going to do this project with sst v3 using React + Vite. I have this base template working: https://github.com/sst/demo-notes-app

Provide a structure for the proposed project. I want to have SSE updates and a nickname + localStorage design that is secure. Describe the files and scope of files needed to make this project come together. 


# ChatGPT: Perfect ‚Äî since you're using **SST v3** with **React + Vite**, and have the [demo-notes-app](https://github.com/sst/demo-notes-app) running, you're already in great shape. Let‚Äôs build a **Conference Buzzword Bingo** project structure on top of that, with:

* **SSE-based real-time leaderboard updates**
* **Nickname + session token stored in localStorage**
* **DynamoDB to track game state**
* **Lightweight anti-abuse & secure token handling**

Would you like:

* A starter file tree zipped up?
* Token signing example (`HMAC-SHA256` using a shared secret)?
* SSE emitter and stream examples using native Node.js?

Let me know where you want to start scaffolding.


# Justin: "Store SSE events in Redis" - is this the only way to replay or resync? 

# ChatGPT: Great question. **No, Redis is not the *only* way to replay or resync SSE events**, but it is often the most **efficient and scalable** method in serverless or stateless environments. Here's a breakdown of **your options**, depending on what kind of "resync" or recovery you want to support.

---

## üîÅ What Do You Mean by Replay or Resync?

There are two main scenarios to handle:

### 1. **Catch Up After Connection Drop**

Client reconnects and wants to get missed updates.

### 2. **Reconnect Without Losing State**

Client refreshes page and still shows current leaderboard, progress, or game state.

---

## ‚úÖ Replay/Resync Options (Ranked by Complexity vs Power)

### **Option 1: Recalculate Current State (No Replay)**

* When the client reconnects, **fetch current state via a REST endpoint** (e.g., `/get-leaderboard`).
* Then start a new SSE stream for future events.

‚úÖ **Best For:** Leaderboards, bingo progress ‚Äî where only the *latest* state matters.

```ts
GET /buzzbingo/leaderboard-state
```

No Redis needed ‚Äî just pull from DynamoDB or aggregate in a Lambda function.

---

### **Option 2: Redis-PubSub or In-Memory Queue**

* Use Redis to publish events from game actions (e.g., `markWord`, `submitBingo`).
* SSE stream handler subscribes to Redis and pushes updates live.
* Optionally retain last X events per channel in a Redis list (`LPUSH + LTRIM`).

‚úÖ **Best For:** Low-latency real-time streaming + basic replay of last 10‚Äì50 messages.

```bash
# When an update happens
LPUSH sse:leaderboard:<game-id> <event_json>
LTRIM sse:leaderboard:<game-id> 0 49
```

When a client reconnects, fetch this buffer.

### **Option 3: DynamoDB Streams**

* Enable **DynamoDB Streams** on your table (e.g., `BingoProgress`).
* Use a Lambda to process stream records and:

  * Push them into Redis
  * Or emit to connected SSE clients

‚úÖ **Best For:** Reliable capture of every game update, even across deploys.

‚õîÔ∏è But it doesn‚Äôt store the events by default ‚Äî **you still need something like Redis or S3** to retain them for replay.

---

### **Option 4: Client-Side Last-Event-ID Header (Built-In SSE Feature)**

* SSE spec supports `Last-Event-ID` header.
* On reconnect, browser can send this value ‚Äî your server then resumes from that point.

‚úÖ **Best For:** Ordered, numbered event streams

‚õîÔ∏è Requires you to:

* Assign **IDs to every event**
* Store all past events temporarily (e.g., in Redis or a database)
* Match based on event ID

Too heavy for your bingo game unless you need precise replay.

## üß† Recommendation for Your Case (Leaderboard Bingo)

| Feature                            | Use It?     | Reason                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| REST fetch for current leaderboard | ‚úÖ           | Simple, fast                                              |
| SSE stream for live updates        | ‚úÖ           | Smooth UX                                                 |
| Redis queue for last 10‚Äì50 updates | üîÑ Optional | Only if needed for catch-up buffer                        |
| DynamoDB Streams                   | ‚ùå           | Overkill for simple leaderboard unless you already use it |

---

## ‚ú® In Short

üëâ You **don‚Äôt need Redis** unless:

* You want to **buffer/replay** past events during reconnection
* You want to **decouple event producers from consumers** for scale

If you‚Äôre okay with simply **reloading the leaderboard on reconnect**, then:

* A **single REST endpoint for state**
* Plus **SSE for live updates**

...is more than enough ‚Äî and much easier to deploy on SST.

Would you like an implementation sketch of both the REST-based "leaderboard fetch" and the SSE live update handler?


# Justin: option 1 seems good. 

Let's go back to our functional goals.
- The leaderboard can be accessed by anyone - on their phone, but also on the big screen
- There should be an admin panel (with username and password?) where I can add, remove words, games, etc. 

Note potential improvements we can build on stage:
1 - user submits a suggested word and people vote on it. Would be another page. 
2 - user needs to submit evidence of their bingo call (e.g. when, where the word was said)
3 - the game can have multiple plays over time, over the conference. People can plan over the course of multiple days. We load new games after the current game is done. 
4 - Since we are using people's nicknames, the winner would be given a secret word upon winning bingo to have someone buy them a beer

Any other ideas?

# ChatGPT: You're building a fantastic, highly extensible, and interactive conference experience ‚Äî it nails both **engagement** and **technical showcase**. Below are your goals, notes on each feature, and some additional fun, useful, or technically impressive ideas you could build live or pre-wire for surprise stage moments.

Would you like a short slide deck with visual mockups for each of the 5 feature ideas to use as prompts while you build? Or a shell repo branch where those 5 feature folders are scaffolded?


# Justin: in the base app, we should have the functionality to automatically start a new game after bingo was called. The frontend should celebrate the winner before connecting to a new game. Does that make sense?

# ChatGPT: Yes ‚Äî that makes *perfect* sense, and it's a strong design both for gameplay pacing and audience experience. Here's how that functionality should work, broken into clear **flow logic**, **backend responsibilities**, and **frontend experience**.

---

## üß† Functional Overview

### üéØ Goal:

After a player successfully calls BINGO:

1. üéâ Show a celebration on their screen (and optionally the leaderboard)
2. üõë Mark the game as complete in the backend
3. ‚è≥ Pause for a short delay (e.g., 10‚Äì15 seconds)
4. üîÑ Auto-load the next scheduled game for all players

---

## üîÅ Backend Behavior

### üóÉÔ∏è `Games` Table Schema

```json
{
  "gameId": "game-001",
  "status": "active", // or "complete" or "scheduled"
  "startTime": "timestamp",
  "wordList": [ ... ],
  "nextGameId": "game-002"
}
```

### ‚úÖ On Bingo Call (`POST /submit-bingo`)

* Validate session‚Äôs current progress

* If complete:

  * Mark game status as `complete`
  * Save `CompletedBingo` entry with nickname, timestamp
  * Return:

    ```json
    {
      "status": "winner",
      "secretWord": "CloudSlam",
      "nextGameId": "game-002",
      "nextGameStartsIn": 15
    }
    ```

* Optional: Push an SSE `winner` event to all connected clients

---

## üíª Frontend Behavior

### On Bingo Submission

1. üéä **If success:**

   * Show a celebratory banner (e.g., confetti, name of winner, beer word)
   * Disable further interactions
   * Show countdown to next game

2. ‚è±Ô∏è After countdown:

   * Reload bingo board and leaderboard with `gameId = nextGameId`
   * Update local state (and optionally localStorage) with new session context

---

## üìà Leaderboard Behavior

* When game ends:

  * Show "Game Over" or "Winner: Nickname" message
  * Reset or fade the leaderboard as new game loads

---

## üõ† Implementation Components

| File / Feature         | Details                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `submitBingo.ts`       | Returns winner response + next game ID                        |

| `Admin Panel`          | Add ‚Äúlink to next game‚Äù option when creating or ending a game |

---

## üéÅ Optional Delight Enhancements

| Idea                                  | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| üé∂ Play a short sound or animation    | Confetti, party emoji, "Level Up!" SFX          |
| üì£ Broadcast ‚ÄúWinner‚Äù message via SSE | Everyone sees ‚Äúüéâ CoolNickname just got BINGO!‚Äù |
| üîÅ Allow fallback to manual reset     | Admin can override auto-start if needed         |
| üìÖ Next game teaser                   | ‚ÄúNext game: 11AM Friday ‚Äì AI Buzzword Edition‚Äù  |

---

### ‚úÖ Yes, it makes sense.

This creates:

* A satisfying close to each round
* A shared event people can witness
* A seamless way to extend play across a full conference

Would you like a sample state transition diagram or an API response schema for the `submit-bingo` call to match this behavior?


# Justin: Ok, now, pretend you are using Cursor.AI and you need a prompt to kickoff the development of this project. Summarize everything we talked about in an effective MD file that describes the tasks that need to be done for the base project, including the functional requirements, the core files, nickname join, SSE, etc. This should be thorough and an LLM that hasn't seen this project at all should be able to take the information and start coding.

# ChatGPT: Here's a `README.md`-style kickoff file that summarizes the entire base project in a way that works beautifully as a Cursor.AI prompt or dev onboarding doc:

## üîê Authentication and Session Design

- Players **join with a nickname**, stored in DynamoDB
- Server issues a **signed session token (HMAC-SHA256)** based on a UUID
- All player API requests include this session ID + token pair
- Token is validated on every request
- Player state is stored in `localStorage`

## üßÆ DynamoDB Tables

### `Players`
```json
{
  "sessionId": "UUID",
  "nickname": "CoolPerson",
  "joinedAt": "timestamp"
}
````

### `Games`

```json
{
  "gameId": "game-001",
  "status": "active" | "scheduled" | "complete",
  "wordList": ["synergy", "leverage", ...],
  "startTime": "timestamp",
  "nextGameId": "game-002"
}
```

### `BingoProgress`

```json
{
  "sessionId": "UUID",
  "word": "synergy",
  "markedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

### `CompletedBingo`

```json
{
  "sessionId": "UUID",
  "completedAt": "timestamp",
  "words": [...],
  "secretWord": "CloudSlam"
}
```

## üîÑ Game Logic Flow

1. Player joins using nickname ‚Üí receives session token
2. Player gets current game board from `/get-board`
3. Player taps words ‚Üí updates stored via `/mark-word`
4. SSE pushes real-time leaderboard updates to `/leaderboard/stream`
5. When player wins:

   * Submit via `/submit-bingo`
   * If verified:

     * Display win message and ‚Äúbeer word‚Äù
     * Mark current game `complete`
     * Auto-load next game after 15 seconds

## üëã Let‚Äôs Build!

You‚Äôre ready to prototype this app live. Start by implementing the `join.ts`, `markWord.ts`, and `sseLeaderboard.ts` endpoints and wiring up the `JoinPage` and `BingoBoard`. Test leaderboard updates and build out from there.
